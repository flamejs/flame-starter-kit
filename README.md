# Flame Starter Kit

This repository contains everything you need to start playing around with your first Flame.js application.

# Important
The most recent Ember version supported by Flame is 1.7.1.
However, any Ember version after 1.0 and before 1.8 contains a bug (https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/3693) that prevents Flame from working correctly. This bug was fixed in 1.8 (https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/5575).

Since Flame does not yet support Ember 1.8 at this point, Ember 1.7.1
has been included in this starter kit, with the fix from https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/5575 backported.
